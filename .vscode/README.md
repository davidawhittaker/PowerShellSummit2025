## Description

This folder contains the recommended extensions and settings for consistently formatting PowerShell code in VSCode. The extensions should automatically install when this folder is opened in a new VSCode window and the settings will automatically apply so long as the workspace is open.

> [!NOTE]
> The settings only apply to the VSCode workspace, and will not persist to other windows or workspaces. In order to make the settings persistent, it will be necessary to import the workspace settings to your own individual user settings.

## Importing Settings

To copy the settings from this workspace into your user settings:
- Open the Command Palette by pressing `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`P`
- Type `User Settings JSON`
- Hit `Enter`
- Copy the values of the [settings.json](settings.json) in this folder into the `settings.json` file opened in the previous step.
